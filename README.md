NEWBIE INSTALLATION GUIDE:
1. Backup any existing Reshade installation you have for the program you're trying to use this with
2. Unzip everything in the same folder as the .exe you will be applying this to
3. Install Reshade normally, making sure you pick the same graphics API (OpenGL, Vulkan, etc.) that the program is using
4. Start up the program and use the hotkeys to pick which preset you want to use

KNOWN ISSUES: Currently the scanline filter doesn't compile properly with DirectX 12, so the presets only have full support for DirectX 9-11, OpenGL and Vulkan

Hotkeys:
**Shift+1:** Disabled
**Shift+2:** RF Signal Mode | Recommended for NES, Master System
**Shift+3:** Composite Signal Mode | Recommended for PC Engine, SNES, N64, Geneis, Saturn, PS1
**Shift+4:** Component Signal Mode | Recommended for Dreamcast, PS2, GameCube, Xbox
**Shift+5:** Dumbass Mode | Mimics exaggerated CRT quirks visible only on a camera
